# Getting Started

## Install Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2013
**NOTE:** For additional resources on the Source engine, visit the [Valve Developer Wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013)

1) Have Steam installed & be logged in.
1. Download ```Visual Studio Community 2013 with Update 5``` [following the instructions on the wiki](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Source_SDK_2013#Step_One:_Installing_Visual_Studio) (requires a Microsoft account). 
1. Extract the ISO into a folder & run the installer.
1. Have ```MFC``` checked - all other optional features can be unchecked.
1. Launch Visual Studio to make sure it works. (You will have to login.)  Then close it after you are sure it works.
1. Install the ```Multibyte MFC Library``` [from the wiki](https://download.microsoft.com/download/0/2/3/02389126-40A7-46FD-9D83-802454852703/vc_mbcsmfc.exe).

## Build AArcade Source Code

7) Clone the ```aarcade-source-client``` repo.
8) Run ```creategameprojects.bat```.
9) Open ```games.sln```.
10) Right-click on Solution (the top of the hierarchy) go to Properties, then Configuration Manager button and change the Active solution configuration from ```Debug``` to ```Release```.
11) Access the ```Client (HL2MP)``` Configuration Properties: Right-click on ```Client (HL2MP)``` project & go to Properties, then Configuration Properties.
12) Add the following to ```C/C++ > Additional Include Directories``` one at a time:
```
..\..\Awesomium\include
..\..\portaudio\include
..\..
```
13) Change ```C/C++ > Treat Warnings As Errors``` to ```No (/WX-)```.
14) Add the following to ```C/C++ > Preprocessor > Preprocessor Definitions```:
```
GLOWS_ENABLE=1
```
15) Add the following to ```Linker > Input > Additional Dependencies```:
```
..\..\Awesomium\lib\awesomium.lib
..\..\portaudio\lib\portaudio_x86.lib
..\..\sqlite\lib\sqlite3.lib

```
16) Set ```Build Events > Pre-Build Events > Command Line``` to:
```
if EXIST ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetFileName) for /f "delims=" %%A in ('attrib "..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetFileName)"') do set valveTmpIsReadOnly="%%A"
set valveTmpIsReadOnlyLetter=%valveTmpIsReadOnly:~6,1%
if "%valveTmpIsReadOnlyLetter%"=="R" del /q "$(TargetDir)"$(TargetFileName)
if exist "..\..\devtools\bin\vpc.exe" "..\..\devtools\bin\vpc.exe" -crc2 "client_hl2mp.vcxproj"
if ERRORLEVEL 1 exit /b 1
```
17) Set ```Build Events > Post-Build Events > Command Line``` to:

if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto BuildEventFailed
if exist "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).map" copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).map" ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetName).map
copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).pdb" ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetName).pdb
if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto BuildEventFailed
goto BuildEventOK
:BuildEventFailed
echo *** ERROR! PostBuildStep FAILED for $(ProjectName)! EXE or DLL is probably running. ***
del /q "$(TargetDir)$(TargetFileName)"
exit 1
:BuildEventOK
```
18) Set ```Build Events > Post-Build Events > Description``` to:
```Publishing to ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.```
19) Copy the contents of a vanilla version of the "Anarchy Arcade" folder from Steam into the ```mp/windows_content``` folder of your project, for debugging purposes.
20) Set ```Debugging > Command``` to your AArcade.exe in your windows_content folder:
```$(ProjectDir)../../../windows_content/AArcade.exe```
21) Set ```Command Arguments``` to the following so you can debug w/o mounts nor workshop content:
```-dev -game frontend -w 1920 -h 1080 -sw -noborder +mounts 0 +workshop 0```
22) Click ```OK``` to save your changes.
23) Add the following filters into the hierarchy of the ```Client (HL2MP)``` project:

| Filter        | Existing Items                             |
| :------------ |:-------------------------------------------|
| aarcade       | `src/aarcade/client/*`                     |
| ges           | `src/game/client/ges/c_ge_door_interp.cpp` |
| hlvr          | `src/game/client/hlvr/vrmanager.cpp`       |

```
if EXIST ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetFileName) for /f "delims=" %%A in ('attrib "..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetFileName)"') do set valveTmpIsReadOnly="%%A"
set valveTmpIsReadOnlyLetter=%valveTmpIsReadOnly:~6,1%
if "%valveTmpIsReadOnlyLetter%"=="R" del /q "$(TargetDir)"$(TargetFileName)
if exist "..\..\devtools\bin\vpc.exe" "..\..\devtools\bin\vpc.exe" -crc2 "server_hl2mp.vcxproj"
if ERRORLEVEL 1 exit /b 1
```
1. Set ```Build Events > Post-Build Events > Command Line``` to:
```
if not exist "..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\." mkdir "..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\."
copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetFileName)" "..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetFileName)"
if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto BuildEventFailed
if exist "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).map" copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).map" ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetName).map
copy "$(TargetDir)$(TargetName).pdb" ..\..\..\windows_content\frontend\bin\.\$(TargetName).pdb
if ERRORLEVEL 1 goto BuildEventFailed
goto BuildEventOK
:BuildEventFailed
echo *** ERROR! PostBuildStep FAILED for $(ProjectName)! EXE or DLL is probably running. ***
del /q "$(TargetDir)$(TargetFileName)"
exit 1

1. Add the following filters into the hierarchy of the ```Server (HL2MP)```
| Filter  | Existing Items |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| aarcade      | src/aarcade/server/*     |
| ges      | src/game/server/ges/ent/*     |
1. Compile ```games.sln```.
1. Success! You win! Next, try ```Run In Visual Studio Debugger```.
1. **ADVANCED USERS NOTE**: You only need to run ```games.sln```.  Advanced developers may choose to use ```everything.sln``` instead - but you'd have to configure the PREBUILD & POSTBUILD output directories for those projects as well to use ```windows_content/frontend``` instead of their default ```game/mod_hl2mp```.

## Run In Visual Studio Debugger

1. Get Anarchy Arcade on Steam & let it completely download.
1. Find your ```[...]/steamapps/common/Anarchy Arcade``` folder & copy the following 15 files out of it & into ```mp/windows_content``` in your project folder.
  - bin
  - config
  - frontend
  - hl2
  - hl2mp
  - platform
  - sdktools
  - sourcetest
  - AArcade.exe
  - arcade_launcher.pak
  - ingamedialogconfig.vdf
  - serverbrowser.vdf
  - stats.txt
  - steam_appid.txt
  - thirdpartylegalnotices.txt
1. Open up the ```games.sln``` solution.
1. Access the ```Client (HL2MP)``` Configuration Properties: Right-click on ```Client (HL2MP)``` project & go to Properties, then Configuration Properties.
1. Set the ```Debugging > Command``` value to be **your** absolute path to the AArcade.exe file you just copied into the ```mp/windows_content``` folder.  For example, ```C:\GitHub\aarcade-source-client\mp\windows_content\AArcade.exe```
1. Set the ```Debugging > Command Arguments``` value to the following:```-dev -game frontend -w 1920 -h 1080 -noborder -sw +mounts 0 +workshop 0```
1. You are now ready to try compiling & testing AArcade in the Visual Studio Debugger by pressing the F5 button.  But it is suggested you follow the ```Create Your First Console Command``` steps below to be sure that everything is working properly.

## Create Your First Console Command

1. Open the ```games.sln``` solution.
1. Open ```console.cpp``` in the ```Client (HL2MP)``` project.
1. Search the document for ```my_first_console_command```.
1. Read the comments in the function body.  Uncomment the ```DevMsg``` line, and customize the text with your own.
1. Save your changes.
1. Press F5 to build & launch AArcade in the debugger.
1. When you reach the ```Main Menu```, bring up the console with the ```~``` key, and type in the command ```developer 1``` followed by ```my_first_console_command```.
1. Success!  You will see the your custom text printed into the console.
